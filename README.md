# Help Jimmy

## A little red ball learns to jump over mean, green hurdles

Help Jimmy is an experiment created over the course of 4 days at Fullstack Academy of Code. Our protagonist, Jimmy the Smiling Red Ball, is in a dangerous, sidescrolling land full of painful green circles. Our job is to help Jimmy jump over the hurdles so he doesn't get hurt.

Unfortunately for Jimmy, we're busy people, so we can't just sit around all day telling him exactly when to jump. Instead, we hooked up a Q learning network to the game so that Jimmy can teach himself!

Jimmy's not exactly the brightest, and we're new to working with neural networks, so Jimmy doesn't always learn how we'd like him to. He'll often just ignore the hurdles, or jump constantly, although more often than not he lands right in the middle of the hurdles. Sometimes, however, he learns proper behavior, so we've implemented the ability to save and load neural network states. There are also some buttons to load up a few network states where Jimmy learned good ways to play.
